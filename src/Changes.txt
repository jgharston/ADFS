adfs.asm, 21-Feb-2016
---------------------
Added LARGE_DISK option, for future use for using full 24-bit sector address.
Added TRIM_REDUNDANT to remove redundant code where possible.
Optimised *INFO code when TRIM_REDUNDANT=TRUE.
Removes Break+-> option when TRIM_REDUNDANT=TRUE.

MMC.asm, 20-Feb-2016
--------------------
Corrected error numbers. Shouldn't be errors, should be return results.

adfs.asm, 26-Mar-2016
---------------------
Added platform-specific define block to generate Electron, BBC, Master ADFS.
Version number/string generated from code capability.
Rationalised IF/ENDIF blocks.

MMC.asm, 27-Mar-2016
--------------------
All routines return result to caller, don't bomb out with errors. Need to
check references to get actual correct result codes.
Optimised MMC_BEGIN and MMC_INIT

adfs.asm, 27-Mar-2016
---------------------
Chopped out redundant floppy sector range test, redundant *DELETE entry
if building for Master. Moved some MMC calls to more appropriate places.
